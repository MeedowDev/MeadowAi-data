## Heat Map Analysis
This heatmap visualizes the correlation between different features in the dataset. Correlation values range from -1 to 1:

| Correlation Value | Meaning | Action to Take |
|------------------|---------|---------------|
| **1.0** (Dark Red)  | Perfect positive correlation (Both increase together) | Likely redundant, consider removing one. |
| **0.5 to 0.9** (Light Red) | Strong positive correlation | May cause multicollinearity, check feature importance. |
| **0 to 0.5** (Light Orange) | Weak positive correlation | Likely useful features. |
| **0** (White) | No correlation | Features are independent. |
| **-0.5 to 0** (Light Blue) | Weak negative correlation | Might still be useful. |
| **-1.0** (Dark Blue) | Perfect negative correlation (One increases, the other decreases) | Likely redundant, consider removing one. |

### **Key Observations & Actions**

### **1. Target Correlation (`crop_variety`)**
- Most values in the `crop_variety` row/column are **close to 0**, meaning **no strong direct relationship** between any individual feature and `crop_variety`.
- This suggests that crop prediction will rely on **combinations of multiple features rather than a single dominant one**.
- **Action:** Keep most features for now, but feature selection may be necessary later.

### **2. Highly Correlated Features (Red Blocks)**
- **High correlations (0.8 - 1.0) indicate redundancy.**
- Example:
  - `t_mean_Q1` is highly correlated with `t_mean_Q2`, `t_max_Q1`, etc.
  - `w_mean_Q1` is highly correlated (~0.9 - 1.0) with `w_mean_Q2`, `w_mean_Q3`, and `w_mean_Q4`.

**Action:**
- Features with **> 0.9 correlation** should be **considered for removal** to prevent redundancy.
- Instead of keeping all similar temperature values (`t_mean_Q1`, `t_mean_Q2`), consider using a **single representative**.

### **3. Weak or No Correlation Features (Near 0)**
- Features with correlations **close to 0** with all other features might not contribute useful information.
- Example: `h_mean_Q1` (Mean humidity, Q1) has very weak correlations with most features.

**Action:**
- If a feature has **very low correlation with everything**, it might be **irrelevant to the prediction task**.
- Consider **removing** these features and checking if model performance improves.

### **4. Multicollinearity (Clusters of High Correlation)**
- **Clusters of strong correlation** (big red squares) suggest that some features carry **similar information**.
- Example:
  - `w_mean_Q1`, `w_mean_Q2`, `w_mean_Q3`, `w_mean_Q4` are **all highly correlated** (~0.9 correlation).
  - `t_max_Q1`, `t_min_Q1`, `t_mean_Q1` are strongly related, which means they might be redundant.

**Action:**
- Instead of keeping all wind speed values (`w_mean_Q1`, `w_mean_Q2`, etc.), **keep only one representative**.
- Use **feature engineering**: Instead of `t_max_Q1`, `t_min_Q1`, use **temperature range** (`t_max - t_min`).

### **5. Negative Correlations (Inverse Relationships)**
- Features with **strong negative correlations (-0.7 to -1.0)** mean when one increases, the other decreases.
- Example:
  - `r_sum_Q1` (Rainfall Q1) has **negative correlation** with some temperature features. This is expected since **higher rainfall often leads to lower temperatures**.

**Action:**
- Negative correlations **are not necessarily bad**â€”they show an inverse relationship.
- **Do not remove them automatically**, but consider them when analyzing feature importance.

### **Final Actions to Take**

| Action | Reason |
|--------|--------|
| **Remove highly correlated features (>0.9)** | Avoid redundancy, reduce complexity |
| **Check weakly correlated features (<0.1)** | May not contribute to predictions |
| **Feature engineering for grouped features** | Use `t_max - t_min` instead of all temperature values |
| **Test removing multicollinear features** | Keep only the strongest predictors |

### **Next Steps**
- **Select features to drop** based on correlation.
- **Train models with and without certain features** to compare performance.
- **Reassess feature importance after training.**
